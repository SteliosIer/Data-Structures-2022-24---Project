# Data-Structures-2022-23---Project Thiseas
Project for the Data Structures Course at Athens University of Economics and Business during winter of 2022/23.

GOAL
Given the StringStack and StringQueue interfaces, create their implementations named StringStackImpl and StringQueueImpl.
Use the StringStackImpl to create a program called Thiseas. The program has to read the labyrinth from a txt file and try to find and print the exit using the backtracking method. If you reach the borders of the labyrinth and you find the value 0, you find an exit. 
The 'E' value is the entrance value to the labyrinth. 

You can read more about it in the assignment paper and in our project report in greek.[assigment paper.pdf](https://github.com/SteliosIer/Data-Structures-2022-24---Project/files/13325416/assigment.paper.pdf)
